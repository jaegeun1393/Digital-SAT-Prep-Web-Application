It offers performance analysis data to help users develop a personalized study path. The analysis tab also includes visual data representations, such as bar and circle graphs, for an intuitive understanding of progress.

## **Class Registration**
As mentioned in the introduction, this platform focuses on tutoring, allowing tutors to create SAT classes, assign homework, and monitor student progress. When a student needs a teacher's support, this feature provides the analysis data to facilitate effective tutoring sessions.
